# Key Insights from "Danish Companies in a Nutshell" 




- **General Trend**:
  - Turnover per employee decreases as enterprise size increases. Smaller companies (0-9 employees) show higher efficiency (around 1,000-2,000 DKK thousand per employee), while larger ones (250+ employees) are lower (around 400-600 DKK thousand).
  - This suggests that small Danish firms may be more agile or specialized, leading to higher per-employee revenue compared to larger, possibly more bureaucratic organizations.

- **Regional Variations**:
  - **Region Hovedstaden** (capital region, purple): Often shows higher turnover per employee across sizes, likely due to concentration of high-value industries like tech, finance, and services.
  - **Region Nordjylland** (red) and **Region Midtjylland** (blue): Tend to cluster in mid-range efficiency, with some outliers in smaller sizes.
  - **Region Sjælland** (orange) and **Region Syddanmark** (green): Generally lower in larger enterprise categories, possibly reflecting more traditional or manufacturing-focused economies.
  - Overall (black): Aggregates show a clear downward slope, with the lowest efficiency in the 250+ employee category (around 390-400 DKK thousand).

## Implications
- Small enterprises in Denmark appear more efficient on a per-employee basis, which could inform policy on supporting SMEs.
- Regional disparities highlight economic differences: Urban areas (e.g., Hovedstaden) outperform rural or industrial regions.
- Data is from 2021, so consider post-pandemic recovery effects when applying insights.
